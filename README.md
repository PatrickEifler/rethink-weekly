## Learn

I'm learning React and Go lang at this time. And I want to learn more.
Recently I started to like fast language like Go, Erlang or Clojure,
Elixir a lots. I think that the best way to learn them is just use them
to write something.

At this time, I also write a book call [Simply
RethinkDB](https://leanpub.com/simplyrethinkdb) and I have been
collecting RethinkDB links and I want to share it with the world. By
building a front-end in React, I can easily swap out and implement
back-end in any language.

In first step, I started with Go, and will continue on Erlang, Clojure,
Elixir later on.
